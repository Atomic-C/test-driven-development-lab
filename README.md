# Test Driven Development Lab #
- Code twice deploy once :D


## What I've learned ##

- Automated testing basically means we write code to test the actual code of our application automatically, meaning we end up with Prod\Dev  Code and Testing Code;
- More time efficient than manual testing which involves launching the application, Login\register, navigate to desired page, populate fields and verify the result.;
- You write them once and they're FREE to run anytime as we require!;
- Bug are caught before deployment and when we deploy, we do it with confidence!;
- Unit Tests test a single class or small unit of related classes (quick);
- Integration Tests cover a greater range of the system by testing the application with it's external dependencies like DB CRUD operations(slow);
- User Interface tests, which cover user interface from buttons to subsystems including database level (slower);

### AAA ###
#### Arrange ####
- Initially create object instances, create test data;
#### Act ####
- Execute application code, call methods;
#### Assert ####
- Check result, test passes or fails? Output vs expected result;
